# Benchmarks 
![Benchmarks](../screenshots/Benchmarks.png)
The Benchmarks stage allows you to measure time of execution of operations over and over again. You can select currently executable operations in the pull down menu. Below that the possibly occuring parameters of the operation will be shown and can be edited. 

There are two frequencies you can adjust to your needs: The first one is for the number that the operation is executed in a row (if possible) if they are added to the operation list, the second one is for the number that the list of operation you created is executed (if possible) when the Execute button is pressed.

Below the adjustment panel the list of operations you created is shown. You can delete single operations by right clicking on the operation you want to remove.

On the right a list of benchmarks will be shown if the operation list is executed.
