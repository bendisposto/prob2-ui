# Project View

If no machine or no project has been opened, the Project View will allow you to create a project. If you choose to open a machine without having a project, a default project will be created.

The Project View contains several tabs:
* __Project__, containing name and description
* __Machines__, containing machines added to this project
* __Verifications__, containing the verification status of each machine
* __Preferences__, containing custom preferences
<!---* __Run Configurations__, containing machines paired with preferences (each pair has its own entry)-->

## Project Tab

## Machines Tab

## Verifications Tab
