If no machine or no project has been opened, the Project View will allow you to create a project. If you choose to open a machine without having a project, a default project will be created.

The Project View contains several tabs:
* __Project__, containing name and description
* __Machines__, containing machines added to this project
* __Verifications__, containing the verification status of each machine
* __Preferences__, containing custom preferences
* __Run Configurations__, containing machines paired with preferences (each pair has its own entry)

##Project Tab

##Machines Tab
![Machines Tab](screenshots/Project/Machines Tab.png)
This tab shows the machines belonging to the project. By using the plus button several machines can be added to the project. By clicking right on a specific machine this machine can be edited or removed from the project.

##Verifications Tab

This tab shows the status of each type of verification run on the machines contained by the project. If no test of a specific verification type has been run, a blue questionmark sign is shown. If the verification type could not recognize any failures, a green check will be displayed. If a test failed, a red x sign will be shown.

##Preferences Tab
